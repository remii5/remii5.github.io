									<p>Taking my keys, remembering to not lose my keys, and opening the door with my keys got quite annoying and boring. So, with machine learning, a servo motor, camera, and raspberry pi, I wanted to design a system that would automate my door lock via facial recognition.</p>
									<p>There were several challenges to overcome. Firstly, I needed to configure a library that could recognize my face and send a message to my motor to turn a certain degree. My solution was to use a popular github repo for the library and store photos I have of myself into the file system. I programmed the camera to take periodic snapshots of what it was seeing and compared it to my library. If there was a match the motor was signaled to either open or close the door lock. Another issue was finding the right motor. Knowing that motor type - servo - would be the best fit for precise turning, researching a catalogue of motors was necessary. My first choice had a weaker output of torque so I had to upgrade to what is shown in my final setup.</p>
									<h2 id="content">Results</h2>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

										<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/scan2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
									<p>The results above show the results from the facial recognition library and snapshots from my camera. The "known" photos I decided to give the raspberry pi had a mixture of me wearing both glasses or not wearing glasses. This allowed me to have successful results whenever I chose to wear the lens. The motor was able to both lock and unlock my door allowing me to access my room at will.</p>
						
									<h2 id="content">Reflections</h2>
									<p>Prior to this project I had never gotten to have hands on experience with some of these tools before. Using machine learning and working with a raspberry pi was completely new to me and was an amazing experience. Finally having an opportunity to get started in the field of engineering was a good way for me to narrow down what I am liking or disliking. From this project alone I have been able to realize that the world Machine Learning, and Digital Systems would be an interesting avenue to look into.</p>
